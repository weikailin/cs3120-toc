Some Papers for Final Projects
========

Reminder: all following papers are accessible through UVA online library, and you can search for the "authors' version" that are open access. For recent papers that are published in conferences, you can often find video recordings of the talks. For example, if paper X is published in "Crypto 24", you can find X in a session Y on the program of Crypto 24 and then find the session Y on Youtube.

- [Notions of reducibility between cryptographic primitives](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-24638-1_1). Omer Reingold, Luca Trevisan, and Salil Vadhan. TCC 2004.

  This is a good paper that revisits important black-box separations.

- [Non-Adaptive Universal One-Way Hash Functions from Arbitrary One-Way Functions](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/431.pdf). Xinyu Mao, Noam Mazor, and Jiapeng Zhang. Eurocrypt 2023.
  
  It is needed to obtain signatures based on OWFs.

- [Foundations for Actively Secure Card-Based Cryptography](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/423.pdf). Alexander Koch, Stefan Walzer. FUN 2021.

  This can be a starting point for active / malicious security.

Some Papers for Final Projects
========

Reminder: all following papers are accessible through UVA online library, and you can search for the "authors' version" that are open access. For recent papers that are published in conferences, you can often find video recordings of the talks. For example, if paper X is published in "Crypto 24", you can find X in a session Y on the program of Crypto 24 and then find the session Y on Youtube.

- [Foundations for Actively Secure Card-Based Cryptography](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/423.pdf). Alexander Koch, Stefan Walzer. FUN 2021.

  This can be a starting point for active / malicious security.

- [Notions of reducibility between cryptographic primitives](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-24638-1_1). Omer Reingold, Luca Trevisan, and Salil Vadhan. TCC 2004.

  This is a good paper that revisits important black-box separations.

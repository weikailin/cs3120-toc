> Class 22: Rice's Theorem
> 
> We recapped reductions. Then, we discussed semantic properties of Turing machines and introduced Rice's Theorem. It extremely powerful and shows many uncomputable functions at once! Slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class22-ink.pdf).

> Class 21: Kolmogorov Complexity
> 
> Today, Alice showed a metric of information in a string: Kolmogorov complexity. It is everywhere whenever we human write anything, but it is a big idea that built on the concept of computation. Alice's slides is [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class21.pdf). My slides will be posted on Thursday together with other slides.

> Class 20: Halting problem, and reduction
> 
> We showed that Halting Problem is uncomputable through a reduction from $$ACCEPTS$$. Also, we discussed Church-Turing Thesis. Slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class20-ink.pdf).

> Class 19: Universal Turing Machines and Uncomputability
> 
> We showed that there are universal Turing machines. Using universal Turing machines, we proved that the boolean function $$ACCEPTS$$ is uncomputable. Slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class19-ink.pdf).

> Class 18: Computability
> 
> We discussed more about some potential variants of Turing machines and how Turing addressed them. We then informally introduced the "computable numbers" and more generally computable functions. Slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class18-ink.pdf).

> Class 17: Turing Machines
> 
> We concluded DFAs and regular expressions with the Cloudflare outage. With that, we formally introduced Turing machines. Historically, there were multiple models of computation, and Alan Turing showed that they are all equivalent to Turing machines.

> Slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class17-ink.pdf). PS7 is now posted and due next Tuesday.

(Potential) Final project papers
==============================

I picked them from Crypto 2023. 
Each of them is chosen to represent one topic in cryptography, 
so there is likely an earlier one easier to work on.
The choices are reflecting my interest, and you may pick your own from related conferences, such as 
Crypto, Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt, STOC, FOCS, TCC, ITC.

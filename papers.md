I picked them from Crypto 2023, and the list reflects my own interest.
Each of them is chosen to represent one topic in cryptography, 
so there is likely a paper published earlier that is easier to read.
You can pick a paper in the following list, an older paper cited by a paper in the list,
or you may pick your own from related conferences,
here is a list: Crypto, Eurocrypt, Asiacrypt, STOC, FOCS, TCC, ITC.

**Proposal (20%):** 1 page, due Oct 18 (Wed). 
Please find your group of at most 2.
Please describe the paper and the topic you picked, explain why the topic is interesting,
and identify 3-5 references (textbook or published papers) that is potentially useful later.
The purpose is to get started early and to let me see if I can help early on.

**Presentation (40%):**
This will be the last 1-2 lectures at the end of semester.
The time slot per group is ~20 minutes.
Your goal is to make the talk comprehensible to other students, 
so that every student will grade all other groups.

**Report (40%):**
Please write the summary of your research in 2-5 pages.
I will read and grade your report.

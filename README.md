UVA CS 3120 Theory of Computation (Wei-Kai Lin)
----------------------------------------
This is the course website of CS 3120 (also called Discrete Mathematics and Theory 2), instructed by Prof. Lin. The meetings are [Tuesdays and Thursdays at **9:30 - 10:45pm** Spring 2026](https://hooslist.virginia.edu/ClassSchedule/ClassHistory?subject=CS&catalogNumber=3120) and in Olsson 120.

**Another section of the same course:**
Prof. Pettit also teaches this course in this Spring 2026. The two sections use **different textbooks** and proceed with slightly **different topics** although the overall goals are similar. The workload of this section shall be similar to the other section, but it is up to the staff's discretion.

> Class 27: Reductions, Review, and Gödel's Incompleteness
> 
> We reviewed the template of reductions by showing the reduction from 3SAT to Maximum Independent Set. We also birefly reviewed the big ideas in this course: counting, reductions, code as data. We wrapped up this course with Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem.

> Class 26: Cook-Levin Theorem
> 
> We proved Cook-Levin Theorem by reducing from any problem in NP to CircuitSAT and by recuding from CircuitSAT to 3SAT. We also talked about some other NP-Complete problems and about the need for P $$\neq$$ NP in cryptography.
> 
> Thanks to Abhishek for pointing out a bug in my slides: BinPacking is easy and computable in polynomial time when there is only one bin. However, for two or more bins of the same size, it becomes NP-Complete to compute whether we can pack all items into the bins. See [this note](https://ac.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/lak_teaching/ws11_12/combopt/notes/bin_packing.pdf) for the definition and reduction.

> Class 25: P vs NP vs EXP, NP-Complete
> 
> We compared class NP to the two classes P and EXP, with a brief definition of class co-NP. We then defined the class of NP-Complete (functions), a first step when human got to understand P vs NP. In the coming Thursday, we will prove Cook-Levin Theorem, which gives the first NP-Complete problem.

> Class 24: Reductions, and class NP
> 
> We introduced some hard problems, including LonggestPath, CircuitSAT, and 3-SAT. Then, we defined the complexity class NP, and we showed that the mentioned hard problems are in NP. The class NP is a big idea in CS. Instead of grouping problems by their computation time, NP groups problems by their **verification time**. At very high level, problems in NP are those "easy to verify" when the instance holds. That includes many problems we know of, and the concept opened many areas in CS.

> Mikhail asked about the *complement* of problems in NP. That is defined as the class co-NP: 
> $$
> co-NP = \{F : F \text{ is a Boolean function and } NOT(F(x)) \in NP \}.
> $$
> We have $$P \subseteq NP$$ and $$P \subseteq co-NP$$, but it is a [long open question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-NP) whether $$NP = co-NP$$.

> We introduced time complexity of Turing machines, and then we defined the class of polynomial-time computable functions.

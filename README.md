Welcome to CS 6222, Introduction to Cryptography!
----------------------------------------

Cryptographic primitives are applied almost everywhere on the network, for instance, encryption and authentication. In this course, we will start from the theoretic foundations that ensures our belief in cryptography, and then we will visit some essential protocols as well as recent advances in cryptography. A major theme of this course is "provable security, " that is, to define the desired security and then to rigorously prove the security is achieved. Hence, students are expected to be familiar with algorithms and mathematical proofs.

Please send me an email if you have questions.

Classroom
---------

**Days and Times:** Monday/Wednesday 2:00-3:15 pm

**Location:** Mechanical Engr Bldg 341 ![UVA Engineering](assets/images/uva-eng.png)

Instructor Contact Information
------------------------------

**Name:** Wei-Kai Lin

**Email:** wklin-course (at virginia dot edu)

Office Hours
------------

**Days and Times:** Tuesdays, 9:30-11:30am (or make an appointment using email)

**Location:** Rice Hall 505

Administration
--------------

We will use the [Canvas](https://canvas.its.virginia.edu) website to manage homework, exam, and grades. Please also use the discuss page on Canvas if you have course related questions.

There will be 4 homeworks (16% each), 1 final project (20%), and 1 final exam (16%). There will be occasional in-class quizzes that give bonus points (10%). The final grade will follow the [CS Department guidelines](https://uvacsadvising.org/policies.html#cs-department-grading-guidelines).

### Homework Policy

The submissions shall be PDF and typeset in Tex/Latex (template will be provided).

Every student shall submit homework individually. You are free to discuss with other students in this class, but in that case, you shall add an "Acknowledgement" paragraph explicitly. Similarly, you are allowed to make use of published material as long as you cite it properly with a "References" section. In any case, it is a violation if you copy text directly, or if you are unable to explain your solution orally to me.

Each student have 4 "late days" for homework in this semester.

There may be additional rules for some homework questions.

### Final Project

The final project is to read research papers in the area of cryptography, to write a 2-page summary, and then to present the topic in class. In addition to summary, you are encouraged to ask novel questions or to propose novel solutions.

The project can be done individually or by a group of two. Both students in the group get the same grade. Each group is required to submit the authors and the research topic in an 1-page proposal (20%) at mid-semester. The summary (40%) is due at the end of the semester, and the last two lectures will be the presentation (40%).

See below for potential research topics.

### Honor System

The goal of this course is to define and prove security. Ideally, all your course works shall be based on the materials given in the classroom and references. You are encouraged to read other materials, but searching for ready-made solutions is discouraged because it hurts the goal. Similarly, please try not to ask for solution from people out of this class, and please try not to use generative AI.

It is a violation if any of the following cases happens:
 - You copied text directly (from any source).
 - You used any material or discussion without acknowledgement or citation.
 - You are unable to explain your work orally to me.

Everyone is required to follow the [Honor Codes of UVA](https://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud) and avoid [plagiarism](https://honor.virginia.edu/plagiarism-supplement).

Please also read [detailed policies](uva_support.md) on the use of AI, accommodations, and supports.

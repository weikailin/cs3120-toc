> Class 11: Universal Circuits
> 
> We showed an efficient construction of universal circuits that is actually a generic way to build a circuit for a Python program (and more generally any program in the "random-access memory" model). 
> 
> That concludes our discussion on circuits. We moved on to Deterministic Finite Automata. The slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class11-ink.pdf).

> Class 10: Circuit Size Hierarchy
> 
> We showed that for every size s, there exists a function that requires roughly circuit size s to compute. It is a cool proof although it is only existential. The slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class10-ink.pdf).

> Class 9: Lower Bound of Circuit Size
> 
> We proved a circuit-size lower bound by applying the representation length of circuits. The slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class9-ink.pdf).

> Class 8: Circuit Size, Representing Circuits
> 
> We went over Problem 1 of PS1. Then, we defined the circuit size classes and discussed the representation of circuits. The slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class8-ink.pdf).

> PRR4 is released on Gradescope, and you are asked to take a look at the [History of Math course](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~alexk/2024F101/) by Professor Alex Kontorovich. PS4 is a written assignment, given in [PDF](assets/pdf/cs3120-ps4.pdf) and [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ggsvhxdwnxbg#34b764).

> Class 7: Universality and Circuit Size
> 
> We finished the universal ways to compute every finite function, and then we moved to circuit size, that is, complexity. The slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class7-ink.pdf).

> Class 6: Computation Models, Universality
> 
> We discuss what are computation models, how are different models compared, and using boolean circuits to compute any finite function. The slides are [here](assets/pdf/cs3120-class6-ink.pdf).
> 
> [PS3](assets/pdf/cs3120-ps3.pdf) and [its template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ncsjqgfrjfys#f36733) are posted. Also, please work on PRR3 before 10pm on the next Monday.
